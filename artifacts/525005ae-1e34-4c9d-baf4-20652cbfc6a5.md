<!-- Section 2: Functional Requirements -->
<section class="prd-section product-requirement-agent" data-keywords="authentication,notifications,responsive,requirements" id="sec_2">
<h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>The application must include user authentication allowing users to register, log in, log out, and reset their passwords.<br/>
Real-time notifications must function through WebSockets allowing clients to receive updates as they happen.<br/>
The design must be responsive, ensuring proper display on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.<br/>
The application must support multiple themes that users can switch between, and it must be designed to accommodate internationalization (i18n) standards.<br/>
The application must include an advanced analytics dashboard that aggregates data from user projects and presents it visually for easier understanding.<br/>
</p>
</section>
<!-- Section 3: Non-Functional Requirements -->
<section class="prd-section product-requirement-agent" data-keywords="" id="sec_3">
<h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>The application must achieve a performance benchmark of loading within 2 seconds on average for all pages.<br/>
It must be secure, employing industry-standard encryption for all sensitive data, especially for user authentication.<br/>
The application should scale to accommodate at least 100,000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation. Furthermore, it must enforce proper error handling to provide user-friendly messages upon failure and implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API endpoints.</p>
</section>
<!-- Section 4: Technical Specifications -->
<section class="prd-section product-requirement-agent" data-keywords="database,users,projects,logging" id="sec_4">
<h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
<p>The application will utilize a React frontend that interfaces with a Node.js backend using Express.<br/>
Database design will consist of models for user profiles, project data entities, and activity logs managed via a NoSQL or SQL database depending on the data access patterns required.<br/>
API endpoints will be designed following RESTful principles, ensuring that they are stateless and cacheable. They will also include standardized error response structures and implement rate limiting to manage traffic effectively.<br/>
The application will include a caching layer to optimize performance and database indexing to enhance query responses.<br/>
</p>
</section>
<!-- Section 5: Acceptance Criteria -->
<section class="prd-section product-requirement-agent" data-keywords="testing,unit-tests,coverage,quality" id="sec_5">
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<p>Unit tests coverage should be above 80% to ensure quality and reliability of the application's functionalities. Test cases must be written for all critical features including user authentication, real-time notifications, and the analytics dashboard.<br/>
</p>
</section><section class="prd-section product-requirement-agent" data-keywords="deployment,docker,kubernetes,containerization" id="sec_7">
<h2>Deployment Strategy</h2>
<p>The application will be containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes for easier deployment and scalability. This strategy will facilitate maintaining different environments, ensure smooth updates, and allow for horizontal scaling based on user load.</p>
</section><section class="prd-section product-requirement-agent" data-keywords="collaboration,websockets,real-time,features" id="sec_6">
<h2>Real-Time Collaboration</h2>
<p>The application must implement real-time collaboration features utilizing WebSocket integration. This will allow multiple users to work on a project simultaneously and see changes reflected in real-time. Users should be able to chat or comment while collaborating, enhancing communication during project work.</p>
