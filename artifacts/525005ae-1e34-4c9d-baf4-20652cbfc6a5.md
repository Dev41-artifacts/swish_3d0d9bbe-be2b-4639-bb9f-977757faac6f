<h2>Climate Change Mitigation through Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion</h2>
<p>Climate change mitigation through ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) could power coastal cities efficiently. This renewable energy technology utilizes the temperature gradient between warm surface ocean water and cold deep water to generate electricity. By harnessing this sustainable energy source, coastal cities can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and improve energy security. OTEC systems also have the potential to create a range of by-products, such as fresh water through desalination, enhancing their overall value to environment and society.</p>
