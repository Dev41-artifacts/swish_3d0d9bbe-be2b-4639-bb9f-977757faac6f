<!-- Section 2: Functional Requirements -->
<section id="sec_2" class="prd-section product-requirement-agent" data-keywords="authentication,notifications,responsive,requirements">
<h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>The application must include user authentication allowing users to register, log in, log out, and reset their passwords.<br>
Real-time notifications must function through WebSockets allowing clients to receive updates as they happen.<br>
The design must be responsive, ensuring proper display on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.<br>
The application must support multiple themes that users can switch between, and it must be designed to accommodate internationalization (i18n) standards.</p>
</section>

<!-- Section 3: Non-Functional Requirements -->
<section id="sec_3" class="prd-section product-requirement-agent" data-keywords="">
<h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>The application must achieve a performance benchmark of loading within 2 seconds on average for all pages.<br>
It must be secure, employing industry-standard encryption for all sensitive data, especially for user authentication.<br>
The application should scale to accommodate at least 100,000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation. Furthermore, it must enforce proper error handling to provide user-friendly messages upon failure and implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API endpoints.</p>
</section>

<!-- Section 4: Technical Specifications -->
<section id="sec_4" class="prd-section product-requirement-agent" data-keywords="database,users,projects,logging">
<h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
<p>The application will utilize a React frontend that interfaces with a Node.js backend using Express.<br>
Database design will consist of models for user profiles, project data entities, and activity logs managed via a NoSQL or SQL database depending on the data access patterns required.<br>
API endpoints will be designed following RESTful principles, ensuring that they are stateless and cacheable. They will also include standardized error response structures and implement rate limiting to manage traffic effectively.</p>
</section>

<!-- Section 5: Acceptance Criteria -->
<section id="sec_5" class="prd-section product-requirement-agent" data-keywords="api,rest,error-handling,rate-limiting">
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<p>The login feature must successfully authenticate users with valid credentials and deny access with informative error messages for invalid credentials.<br>
Real-time notifications should be confirmed by testing multiple users receiving updates without delays.<br>
Responsive design must be validated on various screen sizes, and theme selection must show immediate changes to the UI upon user action.<br>
All API endpoints must respond with appropriate HTTP status codes, relevant data, and proper error messages. Rate limiting must be demonstrated by throttling excessive requests from a single user within a predetermined timeframe.</p>
