# Product Requirements Artifact

## Product Requirements for Real-Time Tracking and Fare Estimation Feature

### 1. Real-Time Tracking
#### 1.1 User Interface
- The map should display the user’s current location, the location of nearby auto-rickshaws, and the route taken by the driver.
- Include a ‘Track my ride’ button that opens a live map during ongoing rides.

#### 1.2 Functionality
- Integrate GPS-based real-time tracking to display the location of the auto-rickshaw dynamically.
- Update the estimated time of arrival (ETA) continuously based on the driver's speed and current traffic conditions.
- Notify the user in case of significant route changes or if the driver takes a longer route unexpectedly.
  
### 2. Fare Estimation
#### 2.1 User Interface
- Display an estimate of fare upfront before booking a ride, based on initial pickup location and destination.
- Show a breakdown of the fare estimate, including base fare, per km charge, waiting time charges, and any applicable surcharges.

#### 2.2 Functionality
- Calculate fare estimates based on real-time distance measurement and traffic conditions.
- Provide an option to display estimated fares for different time slots, e.g., peak hours vs. off-peak hours.
- Include a notification system to alert users about fare changes during the ride in case of significant traffic fluctuations.

### 3. Driver Integration
- Develop a driver app feature that allows drivers to accept rides and see route directions while being continuously tracked.
- Integrate driver verification features to ensure that only local, verified drivers are available on the platform.
  
### 4. Safety Measures
- Incorporate an SOS button for users to quickly report any safety issues during a ride.
- Share the driver's details, including name, vehicle number, and ratings, with users prior to the ride.

### 5. Scalability and Future-Proofing
- Ensure that the design is flexible enough to incorporate additional vehicle types (cabs, bike taxis) without significant overhauls.
- The database should allow for scalable fare calculation logic to accommodate other vehicles with different pricing structures.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Real-Time Tracking
**As a** user,  
**I want to** track my ride in real-time,  
**So that** I can see my auto-rickshaw’s location and ETA so that I know when to expect my ride at my location.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can see their current location and the auto-rickshaw on the map within the app.
- The ETA updates dynamically based on traffic conditions.

### User Story 2: Fare Estimate Before Ride
**As a** user,  
**I want to** get a fare estimate before I book my ride,  
**So that** I can make an informed decision based on my budget.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users enter their pickup and drop locations to receive an upfront fare estimate.
- The estimate breaks down the fare components clearly.

### User Story 3: Dynamic Fare Adjustment
**As a** user,  
**I want to** be notified if the fare changes significantly during my ride,  
**So that** I can confirm whether I still wish to continue or exit the ride.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users receive a notification if the fare exceeds a predefined threshold during the ride, based on updated distance/traffic conditions.

### User Story 4: Safety Features
**As a** user,  
**I want to** feel safe during my ride,  
**So that** I can reach my destination without concerns about my safety.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**As an** admin,  
**I want to** ensure that the app can incorporate different types of vehicles later,  
**So that** we can expand our service offerings without needing major changes to the system.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The existing codebase supports easy addition of cab and bike taxi services.
- Fare calculation methods can adapt to different pricing models based on vehicle type. 

### User Story 6: Driver Verification
**As a** user,  
**I want to** know that the driver is verified and trustworthy,  
**So that** I can feel safe while I travel.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can view the driver's verification badge and rating after a ride is accepted. 
- The app conducts background checks and displays driver verification status prominently.

By adhering to these comprehensive product requirements and user stories, the development team can ensure that the ride-hailing app delivers a robust and user-friendly experience from its inception, prioritizing both user safety and convenience, while setting a strong foundation for future scalability.
