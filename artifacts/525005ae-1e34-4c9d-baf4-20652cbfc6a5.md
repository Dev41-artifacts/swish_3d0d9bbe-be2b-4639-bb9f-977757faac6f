<!-- Section 4: Technical Specifications -->
<section id="sec_4" class="prd-section product-requirement-agent" data-keywords="web-development,react,nodejs,frontend,backend,authentication,notifications,responsive,themes,i18n,accessibility,ui-ux,database,users,projects,logging,api,rest,error-handling,rate-limiting">
<h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
<p>The application will be developed using a React frontend and a Node.js backend, utilizing Express for server-side routing and middleware.</p>
<p>Database: A PostgreSQL relational database will be used to store user profiles, projects, and activity logs. Entity-Relationship (ER) models should be created to guide the database schema.</p>
<p>The API will follow REST standards, utilizing JSON for request and response formats. Endpoints will be defined for all necessary interactions, such as user login, project creation, and notification retrieval.</p>
<p>Front-end technologies will include HTML5, CSS3 (with a framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript (React hooks and state management libraries like Redux).</p>
<p>Real-time notifications will be managed using Socket.IO for bi-directional communication.</p>
